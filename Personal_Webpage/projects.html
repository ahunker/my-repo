            <h2>The Lope de Vega Project</h2>
            <div class="text"> 
            <p>The <a href="http://lope.newtfire.org">Lope de Vega Project</a> is an ongoing project
                that examines texts written in both English and Spanish by early modern Spanish
                playwright FÃ©lix Lope de Vega y Carpio (1562-1635). The aim of the project is to
                identify emotions, body parts, and gender in several of his works available to
                public domain.I was one of three founding members of the project. Each of us worked
                on a separate text. I took on an English translation of <i>The Pilgrim of
                    Castile</i>, one of his more rare prose pieces. A novel split into four books,
                it follows the story of a Pilgrim as he travels Europe and listens to stories told
                by people he meets.</p>
            <p>On my text specificaly, I created structural mark-up and analyzed the text in order
                to tag places, people, emotion, and body parts. I had to distinguish between people
                who were characters, mythical, fictional, and historical and give a short
                descriptions of each mythical, fictional, and historical people. I also had to
                distinguish parts of speech when tagging emotions. Using the information I gathered
                while tagging emotions, I created and SVG graph to visually represent the data.
                Aside from working on my own text, I added Java script to several other parts of the
                website so users could interact by selecting checkboxes that would highlight words,
                names or phrases. </p></div>
