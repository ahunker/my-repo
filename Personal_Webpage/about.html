        <h3>Pets</h3>
        <p>Audrey has had several pets over the years including birds, turtles, fish, hamsters,
            and dogs. She currently owns a rescue dog she adopted from <a
                href="http://animalfriendswestmoreland.org">Animal Friends of Westmoreland</a>. Her new pet is a six year old
            chihuahua/beagle mix. Thankfully, she sounds and looks more like a beagle than a
            chihuahua. Her parents have owned two purebred whippets, Sterling and Strider, for
            several years and Audrey grew up with them in the house. She loves visiting her
            parents' house and bringing Belle along to play with the whippets.</p>
